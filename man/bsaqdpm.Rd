\details{
  This generic function fits a Bayesian spectral analysis quantile regression model
  for estimating shape-restricted functions using Gaussian process priors.
  For enforcing shape-restrictions, the model assumes that the derivatives of the functions are squares of Gaussian processes.
  The model also assumes that the errors follow a Dirichlet process mixture model.

  Let \eqn{y_i} and \eqn{w_i} be the response and the vector of parametric predictors, respectively.
  Further, let \eqn{x_{i,k}} be the covariate related to the response through an unknown shape-restricted function.
  The model for estimating shape-restricted functions is as follows.

  \deqn{y_i = w_i^T\beta + \sum_{k=1}^K f_k(x_{i,k}) + \epsilon_i, ~ i=1,\ldots,n, }
  where \eqn{f_k} is an unknown shape-restricted function of the scalar \eqn{x_{i,k} \in [0,1]} and
  the error terms \eqn{\{\epsilon_i\}} are a random sample from a Dirichlet process mixture of an asymmetric Laplace distribution,
  \eqn{ALD_p(0,\sigma^2)}, which has the following probability density function:
  \deqn{\epsilon_i \sim f(\epsilon) = \int ALD_p(\epsilon; 0,\sigma^2)dG(\sigma^2), }
  \deqn{G \sim DP(M,G0), ~~ G0 = Ga\left(\sigma^{-2}; \frac{r_{0,\sigma}}{2},\frac{s_{0,\sigma}}{2}\right).}

  The prior of function without shape restriction is:
  \deqn{f(x) = Z(x), }
  where \eqn{Z} is a second-order Gaussian process with mean function equal to zero and covariance function
  \eqn{\nu(s,t) = E[Z(s)Z(t)]} for \eqn{s, t \in [0, 1]}. The Gaussian process is expressed with
  the spectral representation based on cosine basis functions:
  \deqn{Z(x) = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \theta_j\varphi_j(x)}
  \deqn{\varphi_0(x) = 1 ~~ \code{and} ~~ \varphi_j(x) = \sqrt{2}\cos(\pi j x), ~ j \ge 1, ~ 0 \le x \le 1}

  The shape-restricted functions are modeled by assuming the \eqn{q}th derivatives of \eqn{f} are squares of Gaussian processes:
  \deqn{f^{(q)}(x) = \delta Z^2(x)h(x), ~~ \delta \in \{1, -1\}, ~~ q \in \{1, 2\},}
  where \eqn{h} is the squish function. For monotonic, monotonic convex, and concave functions, \eqn{h(x)=1}, while
  for \code{S} and \code{U} shaped functions, \eqn{h} is defined by
  \deqn{h(x) = \frac{1 - \exp[\psi(x - \omega)]}{1 + \exp[\psi(x - \omega)]}, ~~ \psi > 0, ~~ 0 < \omega < 1}

  For the spectral coefficients of functions without shape constraints, the scale-invariant prior is used
  (The intercept is included in \eqn{\beta}):
  \deqn{\theta_j | \tau, \gamma \sim N(0, \tau^2\exp[-j\gamma]), ~ j \ge 1}

  The priors for the spectral coefficients of shape restricted functions are:
  \deqn{\theta_0  \sim N(m_{\theta_0}, v^2_{\theta_0}), \quad
	\theta_j | \tau, \gamma \sim N(m_{\theta_j}, \tau^2\exp[-j\gamma]), ~ j \ge 1}

  To complete the model specification, the popular normal prior is assumed for \eqn{\beta}:
  \deqn{\beta | \sim N(m_{0,\beta}, V_{0,\beta})}
